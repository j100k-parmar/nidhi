                <p class="text-justify col-6">I took admission in one of the prestigious schools in Vadodara, Prince Ashokraje Gaekwad school. It is located in Manjalpur. It was established by the Highness of Vadodara in the memory of her late husband, Prince Ashokraje Gaekwad (Grandson
                    of King Sayajirao Gaekwad). I have been studying in the school since nursery and I have a very special bonding with the school, as it provides a very friendly and studious environment. Many religious functions are organized by our
                    school, such as Rath Yatra, Guru Purnima, Christmas, etc. Along with the studies we get a lot of knowledge through various projects given to us. Teachers in this school are amazing, they always make the subject more interesting while
                    teaching. Our school has two parts, one is till Senior Kindergarten, it is named after the queen of Vadodara, Rani Devyaniraje Gaekwad. And the other part is from 1st standard till 12th standard and is named after the late Prince,
                    Prince Ashokraje Gaekwad. We also have lot of sporting facilities such as, basketball, volleyball, gymnastic, etc. Our school provides affordable education. It concentrates on the holistic development of a child. Link of School Website:

Its drawing was put on the display board next day. The kid was my daughter, Nidhee. She has grown up now and her wings of capabilities have also spread. I am proud to be her father as she has surpassed many of my expectations. No doubt she is naughty, may be demanding at sometimes due to her age, but at the same time she has very good understanding and remains updated with her studies and responsibilities. I can only say that I could have not asked for much better daughter to the God than her.</i></p>

I have also got a good friend now in the form of my daughter as she understands the society and the people very well. She helps me in cooking as well as in my routine work and I pray the God to fulfill her all wishes and keep her happy in her life.</i></p>

                    <p>Whenever I am free I love to read novels, encyclopedias and other books. I have read a few novels such as Faster Fenay, Hamlet, Murder on the Orient Express and Sacrifice. My favorite authors are Enid Blyton and Agatha Christie. I
                        like novels because we can learn a lot from them, like: Our Increase in Vocabulary. We learn new words when we read them. We do not repeat mistakes. If we read a biography of a person, we learn from the mistake of the person in
                        biography and we do not repeat it in our life.</p>

                    <p>I like to draw pictures in my free time. Drawing increases our imagination. It helps me understand myself better. Drawing has given me a lot of fame and name because I have won a prize in drawing competition. Ancient people used to
                        draw and convey the situations. One of my favorite painters is Raja Ravi Varma.</p>

                        are Kishore Kumar, Alka Yagnik, Arijit Singh and Neha Kakkar. The apps that I use for listening songs are Gaana and Saavn.</p>

                    <p>I also like watching dramas and movies, but I am very choosy and selective in watching movies. I watch movies which provide us with some values and teachings. I think that watching these kind of movies provide lessons to upcoming generations.
                        For example movies like 3 Idiots convey us that do what your heart wants, not something under pressure of someone and many other philosophical teachings. But I do not watch movies often.</p>

                    me. I spend at least half an hour a day with my friends. They are always there to cheer me up and to boost my confidence level. I have many friends in school but the special one is Janki and in society also I have many friends but
                    the special ones are Vidhi, Krishna and Swara. They always provide a moral support to me. Due to corona I and Janki do not meet very often but we meet at least once a month and we talk to each other over mobile phone. She companies
                    me in almost everything. We fight with each other daily but we also unite again at the end of the day because we know that we cannot live without each other. My friends mean everything to me.</p>

            <p class="pt-3 lh-lg">पढाई एक इंसान के लिए बहुत महत्त्वपूर्ण है. मुझे पढाई इसलिए अछि लगाती है क्योंकि उससे हमारा ज्ञान बढ़ता है और हमारा आत्मविश्वास भी बढ़ता है. हमें ज्ञान हर तरफ से मिलता है सिर्फ उसे पहचान कर हमें उसे बटोरना चाहिए. मै पाठशाला में भी हर पाठ्येतर
                गतिसिधि में भाग लेती हु क्योंकि मेरा मानना है की हम उसमे से भी बहुत कुछ सीख सकते है जैसे की जब हम कोई समूह खेल खेलते है तब हम सबके साथ मिलके काम करना सीखते है, और हम बहुत कुछ सीख सकते है. किसी महान पुरुष ने कहा है की, "काबिल होने के लिए
                पढो, फिर कामयाबी ज़रूर तुम्हारा साथ देगी". ए. पी. जे. अब्दुल कलाम ने कहा है, "अगर तुम सूरज की तरह चमकना चाहते हो तो सूरज की तरह जलना भी सीखो".

A person literally cannot live without mobile nowadays. Mobile has a lot of advantages such as we can talk to a person who is far away in other country, state or city, we can listen to
                        songs anytime anywhere, we can find information about anyone, anything literally. We can chat with our friends, family, etc. Mobiles have become an inextricable part of our lives. Even while dining with our family we use phones
                        or even when we hang out with friends everyone is busy in their phones, some updating status, some clicking pictures, etc. But due to these mobile phones we have forgotten to live the moments. We can definitely use mobiles again
                        but we cannot bring those moments back. We don't realize that using mobiles without having any limits is harming us. The rays from the mobile can also cause brain tumor, it also affects a person's sleep. Nowadays when a child or
                        even an infant starts crying the parent gives him/her mobile so that it stops crying. But the rays which mobiles emit can have adverse effects on the child. Most importantly we have become mobile addicts. We have lost the control
                        on ourselves. People become so engrossed in their mobiles that they do not even have time to look in their surroundings. When we go on a holiday or a trip for a break from our hectic lives, we do not give break to our usage of
                        mobiles. Even there we start using mobile instead of enjoying the moment. We can easily chat with someone who is far away from us but we do not even look at the person sitting beside us. Also because of phones we have forgotten
                        to spend quality time with our family. From my perspective we have become slaves of mobile phones. We must learn to utilize it in a proper way so that we can get good benefit out of it and at the same time we can live in the present
                        life.
